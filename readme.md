# Java I Assignments
Assignment repo for Java I.

# Getting Started
- Clone this repo into a local directory on your computer
- Open your IDE
<!-- - Navigate to the `pom.xml` file (in IntelliJ) and select "Open as Project" -->
- Create a Main class based from the `Main.java.template` file here: `./src/main/java/com.xpanxion.assignments/`
- Create a configuration named "Develop" for this class (Run this class)
- Run the app (Press the green play button)

# What you need to do:
1. WORK WITH YOUR PARTNER to complete the assignments in `/java-1-assignments.md` and then `/java-2-assignments.md`.
2. Work on the assignment in the appropriate method location in the `student/JavaOne` class.
- when you move to Java 2, create a `JavaTwo` class following the same format.
3. Run the Main class `student/Main` to test your result.

# Important Note
Using AI is helpful in explanations, but not when you are learning. Rely on it too much and it will become your crutch. Do not cripple your growth as a developer by overusing it.

If you are already experienced in Java, treat this assignment as if it were a live-coding interview and try your best!
